# Machine Learning Sample
Some machine learnings example for my activity on freeday XD
Built in with Scikit-learn library

# 6 Algorithms Used on This Project
1. KNN
2. Logistic Linear
3. Decission Tree Classifier
4. SVM
5. Gaussian NB
6. Linear Discrimination Analysis

# 2 Evaluate Models For The Datasets
1. K Fold CV ( K Fold Cross Validation )
2. LOOCV ( Leave One Out Cross Validation )

# How it choose it's own best algorithm
There are 2 evaluate models in this project. Each models produce an array that filled up with 6 models and it's accuracy score. So it'll look for the best one and pick it up as the algorithm to use.

# Next Step?
1. Glass Classification Section
2. Image Classification with default datasets from scikit-learn itself
3. Maybe fixed the method of choosing the best algorithm, because sometimes there are 2 algorithms that had same score. So it may use both of them and show it's result.
